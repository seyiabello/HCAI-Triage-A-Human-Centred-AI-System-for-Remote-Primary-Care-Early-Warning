📘 HCAI-Triage

A Human-Centred AI System for Remote Primary Care & Early Warning

🧠 Project Overview

HCAI-Triage is a Human-Centred AI system designed to support remote health assessment, early-warning detection, and clinician-involved triage.
It integrates multimodal data, probabilistic reasoning, sequential decision-making, preference-sensitive recommendations, and explainable AI.
