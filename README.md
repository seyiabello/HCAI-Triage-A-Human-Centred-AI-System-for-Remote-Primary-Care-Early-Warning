# 📘 HCAI-Triage  
*A Human-Centred AI System for Remote Primary Care & Early Warning*

## 🧠 Project Overview
HCAI-Triage is a Human-Centred AI system designed to support remote health assessment, early-warning detection, and clinician-involved triage. It integrates multimodal data, probabilistic reasoning, sequential decision-making, preference-sensitive recommendations, and explainable AI.
